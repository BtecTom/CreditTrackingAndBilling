Assumptions
"customer" is an org, so user must be part of an org?
user allocated reports/ month isnt changing often
"... over a couple of weeks" assumed that after 2 weeks this means they are blocked wether they have used all 10 or not
"on track to hit limit" 90% usage?
User Auth is a seperate system and as long as the tocken matches its ok
Setting user limits doesnt validate the whole plan can accomidate; 100 reports, 2 people doesnt error on 60 each

Use Report Credit states "accept the org identifier and the enquiry identifier" but not the user ID?

DB objects
"plan" - which plan the org is on
	Plan ID
	Name
	Reports/Month
"user" - user
	User ID 
	Org ID
	Reports Ran in Month
	Last Ran Report Date Time
"Org" - orgs associated with xapien
	Org ID
	Plan ID

	Reports Ran in month
	Last Ran Report Data Time
	Topup reports
	Data of Last Topup
"reports ran" - keep track of the reports
	Report ID
	Report was aloud
	Generated Report ID - this is an external number so dont want to use as PK
	User ID
	Report Data Time
"trail user" - user on trial, not in an org
	Identifier - not a customer so this might just be a seeded hash of their email?
	reports used
	First report ran time
	Trial Completed

End points;
